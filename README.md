## Installation
To install locally, clone repo from GitHub and run <npm i> in the command line. Initiate server by running <nodemon server.js>

## Usage
The app features two separate user views. One view is publically available and does not require account authentication. This is to allow persons in need to access resources semi-anonymously (does not prevent IP address tracking). The other view requires a service provider user to create an account and login in order to post an event or resource available
